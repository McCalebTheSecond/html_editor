## What is HTML Helper?

HTML Helper is a small, single-page, offline HTML playground.

At a high level:
- **Editor + preview**: The screen is split into an HTML template editor on the left and a live preview on the right.
- **Variables**: You can define named variables in a simple table, and the template is rendered using those values.
- **Live feedback**: As you edit the template or variables, the preview updates so you can quickly iterate on snippets, emails, or small pages.
- **No backend**: Everything runs in the browser, opened directly via `file://` with no server, build step, or network dependency.
- **Local persistence**: The current template and variables are stored locally so you can close and reopen the page without losing your work.
